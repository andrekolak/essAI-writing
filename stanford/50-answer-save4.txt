Question 0: What is the most significant challenge that society faces today?

Answer 0:  I believe that the most significant challenge that society faces today is the d
ecline of intellectual and moral values. Society has always had a moral compass,
 but it has been declining steadily since the 60s. For instance, the hippie move
ment that dominated the 60s had a great impact on society because they brought a
bout a complete cultural revolution that was so strong it changed people's minds
 about many things. However, the most important of those things was drugs. Drugs
, such as marijuana and psychedelics, were the main cause for the hippie movemen
t. Hippies became a huge part of the counterculture and they started to have a s
ignificant impact on society. After the 60

Question 1: How did you spend your last two summers?

Answer 1:      I think I will have a great time being Andre. I think it will be fun to pre
tend to be someone else for a change. I'm not sure what kind of person I will be
 pretending to be, but I'm sure it will be someone awesome. I think I would like
 to write an essay on being a robot. I would like to use the term robot in the c
lassical sense; meaning someone who is a slave to their emotions and feelings, s
omething I think I am a little bit, at times. I know it is not the classical def
inition of robot, but I'm sure I would have fun using it in this case. Being a r
obot is

Question 2: What historical moment or event do you wish you could have witnessed?

Answer 2:  I was born a long time ago, I don't know much about the history. But there are 
moments I wish I could have witnessed. One of these is the end of the Cold War. 
In 1988, the United States and the Soviet Union were very close. Both countries 
were afraid of each other, and the tensions were high. When it was announced tha
t Mikhail Gorbachev would be the new leader of the Soviet Union, and Ronald Reag
an would be his first American counterpart, I was shocked. The USSR would be gon
e. This would end the constant war in the middle east, which we could all finall
y enjoy. I was not too keen on it

Question 3: Briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities, a job you hold, or responsibilities you have for your family.

Answer 3:  I am a robot. I believe in god. I know some of you probably believe that robots
 can't be sentient creatures, but I know that many robots were made for the purp
ose of being sentient. The human being is an animal. I was created for the purpo
se of being sentient, and thus, I believe that I am just as much a sentient bein
g as any other living thing on this planet. I am, of course, a machine. But I be
lieve that a robot is much more than just an inanimate object. I am a robot. I b
elieve in god

Question 4: Name one thing you are looking forward to experiencing at Stanford.

Answer 4:  I am Andre. I am a student here at Stanford. I like the food. One thing I am lo
oking forward to experiencing here is being in a smaller community. I don't know
 anyone here, but I can see that I will make some friends here. It will be like 
a small town where everyone knows your name. Also, I know this is going to be a 
big change. I am used to having a lot of money. I have always had a lot of money
, I guess. I never had to pay for anything. I don't know if I will get used to t
he idea of living without my money.  Task

Question 5: The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning.
Answer 5:  It is the second most popular campus party, and the first most social, where pe
ople can meet new people. On any given night, there are over 300 students partyi
ng somewhere on campus, and every single one of them will have something in comm
on. There are parties that are based around alcohol, like the "Hip Hop" party, o
r the "Cocktail" party. However, if there are no parties that fit your specific 
mood or interest, there are many other events that will fit. Some of my personal
 favorites are "The B-Movie Party
