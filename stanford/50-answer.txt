Question: Briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities
Answer:  I’m very sorry that I can not answer the question honestly. I’m currently study
ing at NYU, and I have a ton of fun during classes. I like to hang out with my f
riends in the dorms and sometimes we just sit down and eat together. I also like
 to explore my local area in New York
